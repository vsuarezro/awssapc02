• Configuring data and database replication
• Performing disaster recovery testing
• Architecting a backup solution that is automated, is cost-effective, and
supports business continuity across multiple Availability Zones or Regions
• Designing an architecture that provides application and infrastructure
availability in the event of a disruption
• Using processes and components for centralized monitoring to proactively
recover from system failures

Task Statement 2.3: Determine security controls based on requirements.
Knowledge of:
• IAM

• AWS managed security services (for example, AWS Shield, AWS WAF,
Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub)
Skills in:
• Specifying IAM users and IAM roles that adhere to the principle of least
privilege access
• Specifying inbound and outbound network flows by using security group
rules and network ACL rules
• Developing attack mitigation strategies for large-scale web applications
• Developing encryption strategies for data at rest and data in transit
• Specifying service endpoints for service integrations
• Developing strategies for patch management to remain compliant with
organizational standards

Task Statement 2.4: Design a strategy to meet reliability requirements.
Knowledge of:
• AWS Global Infrastructure
• AWS storage services and replication strategies (for example Amazon S3,
Amazon RDS, Amazon ElastiCache)

[Amazon SNS], Amazon Simple Queue Service [Amazon SQS], AWS Step
Functions)
• Service quotas and limits
Skills in:
• Designing highly available application environments based on business
requirements
• Using advanced techniques to design for failure and ensure seamless
system recoverability
• Implementing loosely coupled dependencies
• Operating and maintaining high-availability architectures (for example,
application failovers, database failovers)
• Using AWS managed services for high availability
• Implementing DNS routing policies (for example, Route 53 latency-based
routing, geolocation routing, simple routing)

Task Statement 2.5: Design a solution to meet performance objectives.
Knowledge of:

• Applying design patterns to meet performance objectives with caching,
buffering, and replicas
• Developing a process methodology for selecting purpose-built services for
required tasks
• Designing a rightsizing strategy

Task Statement 2.6: Determine a cost optimization strategy to meet solution goals
and objectives.
Knowledge of:
