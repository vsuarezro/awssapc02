Domain 4: Accelerate Workload Migration and Modernization
Task Statement 4.1: Select existing workloads and processes for potential migration.
Knowledge of:
• Migration assessment and tracking tools (for example, AWS Migration Hub)
• Portfolio assessment
• Asset planning
• Prioritization and migration of workloads (for example, wave planning)
Skills in:
• Completing an application migration assessment

• Data migration options and tools (for example, AWS DataSync, AWS
Transfer Family, AWS Snow Family, S3 Transfer Acceleration)
• Application migration tools (for example, AWS Application Discovery
Service, AWS Application Migration Service)
• AWS networking services and DNS (for example, Direct Connect, AWS
Site-to-Site VPN, Route 53)

• Selecting the appropriate application transfer mechanism
• Selecting the appropriate data transfer service and migration strategy
• Applying the appropriate security methods to migration tools
• Selecting the appropriate governance model

Task Statement 4.3: Determine a new architecture for existing workloads.
Knowledge of:
• Compute services (for example, Amazon EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
• Containers (for example, Amazon Elastic Container Service [Amazon ECS],
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service [Amazon EKS], AWS Fargate, Amazon
Elastic Container Registry [Amazon ECR])

• AWS storage services (for example, Amazon S3, Amazon EFS)
• Purpose-built databases (for example, DynamoDB, Amazon Aurora
Serverless, ElastiCache)
• Integration services (for example, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, Amazon
EventBridge, Step Functions)
Skills in:
• Identifying opportunities to decouple application components
• Identifying opportunities for serverless solutions
• Selecting the appropriate service for containers
• Identifying opportunities for purpose-built databases
• Selecting the appropriate application integration service
